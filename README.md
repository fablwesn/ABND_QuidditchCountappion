# ABND_QuidditchCountappion

This was my second project submission for the Android Basics Nanodegree Program

ABND by Google: https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803

the objective was to biuld a really simple app for tracking a score of some sports or game.
I choose Quidditch, because I'm no real soccer fan or fan of similar sports. The one's I wanted, like
Tennis, would't work without any if-statements so i choose something nerdy <3
